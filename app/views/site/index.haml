    %h4 How it works
    %p Every two weeks you'll receive an email with the name and email address of your pairing. The pairing is randomly assigned and avoids repeats. From there it's up to the both of you to organise a time that works for a catch up. We recommend you schedule 30 minutes for your meet-up, but of course you are welcome to spend longer if the convo (and coffee) keeps on flowing ðŸ˜Š
